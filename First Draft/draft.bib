	Abstract = {In this paper we outline a framework for creating player- centred digital games. At the core of our proposal is the requirement for games to be more responsive to different player types and their individual needs; for games to have the capability to adapt so as to provide an appropriate level of challenge for each player, to smooth the learning curve, and enhance the gameplay experience for each player individually. This is not an easy objective to achieve and adaptive game technology, although a popular ideal in some quarters, is still fraught with difficulties and some controversy. We address some of the most well known issues and outline a proposal for dealing with two of the more recent issues: that of monitoring the effectiveness of game adaptation on the basis of player intention and/or frustration, and dealing with dynamic player profiles -- because players learn in different ways and at a different speed.},
